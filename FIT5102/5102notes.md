questions:
What is the main argument presented by Nicholas Carr in the article?
• How does Carr define "commodity technology," and why does he argue that IT has
become one? What are the reasons for Carr’s arguments?
• Do you agree or disagree with the author’s argument?
• How does he support his claims?
### • What is the difference between “strategic IT” versus “commodity IT”?
Difference Between "Strategic IT" and "Commodity IT":

Strategic IT: Refers to innovative and proprietary technologies that provide a company with a distinct competitive edge, often through unique applications or processes tailored to specific business strategies.​

Commodity IT: Encompasses widely available and standardized technologies essential for operations but do not confer unique advantages, as they are easily replicable by competitors.

• Since Carr’s article was published in 2003 do you think his arguments would still hold considering the technological changes in businesses?
it is because the landscape of IT and business strategy has undoubtedly and continuously evolved.
