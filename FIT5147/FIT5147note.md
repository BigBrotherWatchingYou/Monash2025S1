wrap-up is what you have to do

Week1: read the books
https://learning.monash.edu/mod/book/view.php?id=3760849
https://learning.monash.edu/mod/book/view.php?id=3760850
video: data expooration and visualisation monash
learn: javascript--learn how to use it and use live server to update the web
R language
GGplot
0
any problem in the question?
2 weeks to do it
use javascript for dap
for dvp you can use R or javascript

note for week2:
### assignment released and you need to do it before next Monday
# orderded and catagorical
## how to format/calculate or use tableau:

how to use GGplot
https://learning.monash.edu/mod/book/view.php?id=3760897

and there's a file in FIT5147 week2

initialising ggplot:
tools- install packages- ggplot2
run code:install.packages("ggplot2")

test:

Tabular data
Spatial data
Network data
Textual data

## variable

Univariate analysis focuses on a single variable while bivariate analysis examines the relationship between two variables.

### ggplot commands
geom_bar(): creates a layer with bars representing different statistical properties.
geom_point(): creates a layer showing the data points (as you would see on a scatterplot).
geom_line(): creates a layer that connects data points with a straight line.
geom_smooth(): creates a layer that contains a ‘smoother’ (i.e., a line that summarizes the data as a whole rather than connecting individual data points).
geom_histogram(): creates a layer with a histogram on it.
geom_boxplot(): creates a layer with a box–whisker diagram.
geom_text(): creates a layer with text on it.
geom_density(): creates a layer with a density plot on it.
geom_errorbar(): creates a layer with error bars displayed on it.
geom_hline(), geom_vline(): straight lines

## common analytics for Tabular Data
Aggregation
You might want to make generalizations so you can see how it affects certain categories rather than each item in the category. For example, If you've got privacy issues where you don't want to include every item of every observation.
Correlation
If we think there is a strong relationship between two variables, we say they have a high correlation. This means that if one changes, then the other will change as well.
Curve filtering / regression
We want to know which of the variables might change that dependent variable in some way.
Dimension reduction
Change the data from being thousands, millions of dimensions down into a small number of dimensions so that we can visualize easier and analyze in various ways.
Filtering
Sometimes we don't want to differentiate between different components of our population or sample population that the data relates to. For instance, we might decide that we want to look at if we're looking at most popular soft drinks, that we only want to look at the males in this population.
Clustering
Clustering analysis allows us to say which part of the data would be in which cluster, and what are the attributes of each cluster in accordance to the data?
Ranking/ordering
Reorder the categories so the distance between the maximum and minimum is clear as well as the similarity between the values for each category. How you ordered them could be based on the actual values, or you might actually have an established rank to order them by. For instance education level is ordered, but it doesn't have a value.
Factor analysis
Finds linear combinations of variables that best explain the relationships between the variables, through clustering the variables rather than the observations.
Summary statistics
Good for indicating how regular the values are, how spread out they are and suggest what sort of distribution they have. Indicates the general bias that might be possible in the data. It also helps us identify outliers and various patterns.
